const e="```ts\r\nstoch(\r\n  close: number,\r\n  high: number,\r\n  low: number,\r\n  length: number\r\n): number\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalculates the stochastic oscillator value, a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price to a range of its prices over a certain period.\r\n\r\n## Parameters\r\n\r\n- `close`: The current closing price.\r\n- `high`: The current high price.\r\n- `low`: The current low price.\r\n- `length`: The number of bars to consider for calculating the highs and lows.\r\n\r\n## Returns\r\n\r\n- The stochastic oscillator value as a percentage.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe `stoch` function computes the stochastic oscillator, which is widely used in technical analysis to generate overbought and oversold signals by comparing the closing price to a range of prices over a specified period. The function maintains a record of the highest and lowest values over the `length` period and calculates the oscillator as \\( 100 \\times \\frac{\\text{close} - \\text{lowest}}{\\text{highest} - \\text{lowest}} \\). This indicator helps in identifying potential reversal points in the market, as values close to 100 indicate overbought conditions and values close to 0 indicate oversold conditions.\r\n\r\n*Note: The accuracy and relevance of the stochastic oscillator are contingent on the specified `length` and the quality of the price data. It's essential to interpret this indicator in conjunction with other tools and market factors for effective trading decisions.*\r\n";export{e as default};
