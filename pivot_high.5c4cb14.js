const e="```ts\r\npivot_high(\r\n    value: number,\r\n    lengthBefore: number,\r\n    lengthAfter: number\r\n): number | null\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdentifies the pivot high point in a series of values, defined as the highest value within a specified number of bars before and after the current value.\r\n\r\n## Parameters\r\n\r\n- `value`: The current value from which the pivot high is to be identified.\r\n- `lengthBefore`: The number of bars to the left (before) of the current value to consider.\r\n- `lengthAfter`: The number of bars to the right (after) of the current value to consider.\r\n\r\n## Returns\r\n\r\n- The price of the pivot high point if found; otherwise, `null`.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe `pivot_high` function is designed to detect significant high points in a data series, which are often indicators of potential market turning points or support/resistance levels. It examines the range of bars specified by `lengthBefore` and `lengthAfter` around the current value and identifies the highest point within this range. This point is considered a pivot high if it is higher than all other values in the specified range. If no such point exists, the function returns `null`. This tool is particularly valuable in technical analysis for pinpointing key levels that might influence future price movements.\r\n\r\n*Note: The function's ability to identify a pivot high is contingent on the availability and accuracy of data for the specified range of bars. Incomplete or noisy data may affect the reliability of the pivot high identification.*\r\n";export{e as default};
