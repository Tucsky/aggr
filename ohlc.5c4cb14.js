As new values are processed, the function updates the high and low prices if the incoming value exceeds the current extremes. The latest value is always set as the close price. This function is crucial for real-time financial charting, where it's important to capture the extremes of price movements and the final price at the end of a time interval.\r\n\r\n*Note: The OHLC data is vital for technical analysis in trading, providing information about price volatility and market trends during the charting period.*\r\n";export{e as default};
