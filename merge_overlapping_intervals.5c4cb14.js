The function first sorts the intervals by their starting points. It then merges overlapping intervals by calculating weighted averages of their start and end points, accumulating their strengths, and combining their identifiers. The merged intervals are then filtered based on a specified strength threshold, ensuring that only significant intervals are retained. This function is particularly useful in contexts where overlapping data ranges need to be consolidated, such as in event scheduling, resource allocation, or in financial analysis for combining similar price ranges or time periods.\r\n\r\n*Note: The function's effectiveness in accurately merging intervals depends on the integrity and format of the input data. Careful consideration of the threshold parameter is important for ensuring meaningful output.*\r\n";export{e as default};
