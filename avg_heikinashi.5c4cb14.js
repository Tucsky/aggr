const e="`avg_heikinashi(renderer: Renderer): { time: number, open: number, high: number, low: number, close: number }`\r\n\r\nCalculates the Heikin-Ashi values for the average of all active sources contained within the renderer's bar, using the Heikin-Ashi technique, which in Japanese means \"average bar\". This method is used to average price movements and create a smoothed chart representation.\r\n\r\n## Parameters\r\n\r\n- `renderer`: The full bar object containing various sources of OHLC data.\r\n\r\n## Returns\r\n\r\nAn object containing the averaged Heikin-Ashi values:\r\n- `time`: The local timestamp from the renderer.\r\n- `open`: The average of the open values of active sources, adjusted to Heikin-Ashi technique.\r\n- `high`: The average of the high values of active sources.\r\n- `low`: The average of the low values of active sources.\r\n- `close`: The Heikin-Ashi close value, calculated as the average of the open, high, low, and close values.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe `avg_heikinashi` function averages the OHLC values of all active sources within the renderer's bar, employing the Heikin-Ashi calculation to produce a single smoothed candlestick.
