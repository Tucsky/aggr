It uses a weighting factor \\( k = \\frac{1}{\\text{length}} \\) to determine the impact of the most recent data point in the calculation. If there are previous data points available, the RMA is calculated using the current value, the last RMA value, and the weighting factor. If not, the RMA is initially set to 1. This calculation method makes the RMA particularly useful in situations where recent changes are more significant than older data, such as in financial markets for trend analysis or in tracking recent performance metrics.\r\n\r\n_Note: The responsiveness of the RMA to recent changes depends on the specified length; a shorter length results in a moving average that is more responsive to recent data, while a longer length averages out the data over a longer period, providing a smoother and less volatile average._\r\n";export{e as default};
